# pillminder

## Inspiration
During these very busy days, it is hard to keep track of the hourly medicines that elderly and people with special needs consume. There have been many incidents recently how people have suffered because of overdose or health issues because they might have missed to take a pill or two.
We wanted to develop a model that keeps track of these pills and sends alerts or reminders to their care-takers.

## What our App does?
Our PillMinder app always monitors the pillbox which contains the medicines organized for the entire week. This camera constantly monitors the pillbox and talks to the backend server which communicates to the mobile app which can be installed by the caretakers. If there is any missing dose or overdose . It immediately alerts the caretaker, and they can take necessary actions.
